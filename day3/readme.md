Shopping Management System (C++)

A simple console based shopping application written in C++.
The program simulates a basic shopping flow using predefined products, payment rules, and discount logic.

Overview of the project

This project demonstrates how to build a small shopping system using C++ and STL.
Users can view available products, select items to buy, choose a payment method, and receive a purchase summary with discounts applied.

Features

1. Predefined product catalog (no user input for products)

2. Product selection using product IDs

3. Multiple payment options (UPI, CARD, COD)

4. Discount calculation based on total amount and payment method

5. Restriction on COD for electronic items

6. Clean, formatted purchase summary output

Concepts Used

1. Object-Oriented Programming (classes and constructors)

2. STL containers (map, vector)

3. Structs for data modeling

4. Iterators and range-based loops

5. Conditional logic and basic business rules

6. Output formatting using setw and left

How It Works

- User enters their name.

- Available products are displayed.

- User selects products by ID.

- Payment method is chosen.

- The program processes:

  1. Total amount

  2. Discounts

  3. Payment restrictions

- A detailed purchase summary is shown.
